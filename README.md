# Mini Visualization Tool
This project is a mini visualization tool built using React, designed to interact with the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). 
It allows users to explore trivia questions distributions across categories and difficulty levels using interactive charts.


## Features

- Display a list of available trivia categories using a dropdown.
- Filter to view data for a single category or all categories. 
- Visualize the number of questions in each category using a bar chart.
- Visualize question difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) using a pie chart.
- Dynamic Loading State: Shows a loading spinner while fetching categories and question counts.
- Responsive UI

## Technical Details

- Frontend Framework: [React](https://react.dev/) (functional components and hooks)
- Data Visualization: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US) library for BarChart and PieChart components
- API Integration: [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). 
- State Management: React Context API (useTrivia context)
- Styling: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for modular, maintainable CSS
  
> Data Fetching: Categories are fetched first, then question counts for each category are fetched in parallel with Promise.all; since the task is focused on distributions by category and difficulty, I used the count endpoint as itâ€™s more performant and accurate, avoids unnecessary API calls and processing overhead. If the project required showing actual questions or other metadata (e.g., text analysis, types), then fetching raw questions would make sense.
